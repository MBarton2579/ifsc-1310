            <p>Progressive enhancement is a web practice in which web developers provide the most critical content and functionality to as many users as possible while providing a greater experience for users accessing the web on newer browsers and machines.</p>
            <p>Progressive enhancement is important because of its inclusiveness. This practice is a way for web developers to say “We Care” to all the users who do not have the privilege of browsing on the newest machines or browsers. With the continuation of this practice, web developers can make sure that the standards of the web are upheld and pushed to further extents. This way no user is left behind and the web can strive for its dream to be accessible to everyone no matter the situation.</p>

            <header><h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2></header>
            <p>For my project, I decided to take a sleek and simple approach to design my website. I didn’t want the content to be overwhelmed by excessive design features. The design looks somewhat innovative to reflect the nature of the SpaceX Dragon project. I would have loved to recreate the structure of my professor’s website. I was having issues with the articles so I had to compromise. But even so, I think it came out pretty good and may have been better than what I tried to replicate. It was more like putting my own little spin on the original design. Things came out pretty well in the end. I am proud of the finished product and believe the product is suitable for use.</p>
            <p>The feedback I received for my website was good. All the content worked properly. There were no major design issues pointed out and I received compliments for my work. A few small things that were brought to my attention were the theme choice and the too simple design. My reviewers said that the bright red color for titles was a bit out of place. I wanted to put my own spin on the website but I decided to change the color to a dark blue in response to their concerns. Additionally, to solve the simple nature of my site I used the opportunity to implement javascript to bring life to the website. I changed the once still photo at the bottom of the home page to a cycle of images using the turn-down effect. I believe that should solve both issues that came up during the review. Other than adding some familiar CSS, resizing the images to fit the cycle, and restructuring the container nothing content-wise changed. I feel that the design is worthy of being the final design.</p>
